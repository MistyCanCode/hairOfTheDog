			<p>Lorelei has been grooming since she was in high school. Shadowing and bathing for her sister, she quickly fell
			in love with the craft. When she moved from Florida to Tennessee after school she started work for PetCo where
			she continued her training and advanced to management. From there, she decided it was time to start her own grooming 
			business. With the help of her co-owner Samantha, and her supportive family, she made the leap to Hair of the Dog.</p>

			<p>Samantha met Lorelei while they both worked at PetCo. They became instant friends, bonding over their shared love of
			animals and their passion for grooming. Samantha started grooming 10 years ago while working toward an Associates Degree
			to be a Veterenary Assistant. While she has completed her degree, she also fell into competetive grooming. So when the opportunity
			came to open a grooming business, she jumped at the chance. This is the team that makes up Hair of the Dog.</p>
